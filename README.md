I wanted a website where happy (or angry) people can come in and review products they own.

I wanted this application to be really user friendly and interactive.

I implemented a lot of things but I want to keep going and make this bigger and better. I loved working on this project so I will be working more on this in the future.

Things I want to add:

- Like and dislike a reviews
- Edit profile through 'profile' instead of users.
- A form where I can get emails for bugs or requests.
- Image upload input to grab files from your computer instead of URL.
